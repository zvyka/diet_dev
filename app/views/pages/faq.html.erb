        <dt>How do I make a meal?</dt>

				<dd>To make a meal, go to your <b><%= signed_in? ? link_to('home', user_path(current_user)) : link_to('home', root_path) %></b> page and select the <b>date</b> you ate the meal. Select the time of day and location if you'd like. Then, start typing your food into the <b>input field</b>. Once you start typing, a list of possible matches from the database shows up. If there are too many matches, try refining your search (eg. "Chicken Pot Pie" instead of "Pie" or "Chicken") and/or scrolling the list to find the best match for what you ate. Change the number in the serving size box if necessary (this number can be a decimal, such as 0.5). You may also remove items by clicking the x on the top-right corner of the box.</dd><br/>
				
				<dd>If you would like to add another item, simply press <b>the plus sign</b> and follow the steps above. Once you are done adding your meal, press <b>"Submit"</b>, and that's it!</dd>
				
				<dt>Okay, but what if I forgot something? How do I edit a meal?</dt>

				<dd>To modify an existing meal, go to your <b><%= signed_in? ? link_to('home', user_path(current_user)) : link_to('home', root_path) %></b> page. Your existing meals show up as graphs on the calendar on the day they were eaten. Clicking on the graph will bring you to the <b>meal show page</b>, which shows you an overview of that day's meals. If you would like to <b>delete</b> the meal, press <b>"Delete"</b>, but remember that once a meal is deleted it cannot be recovered. You can add or remove foods by editing your meal. Editing the meal is as easy as making one: simply click <b>"Edit"</b> and you will be taken to the same form you used to submit the meal. Make any changes you'd like (even change the date!) and click <b>"Submit"</b>, and presto, you can view your changes!</dd>
